# Scalable Tic Tac Toe in C

This is a simple terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game written in C. It allows custom board sizes beyond the classic 3x3, making it a good practice project for working with arrays, logic loops, and user input in C.

## Features
- Dynamic board size selection
- Win condition adapts to board size
- Basic input validation
- Minimal use of external libraries (only standard C)

## Purpose
This was my first real C project. It’s not polished or optimized — it was made purely to practice core concepts and get more familiar with the C language.

## How to Compile
```bash
gcc -o tictactoe tictactoe.c
./tictactoe
